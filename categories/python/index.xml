      <description>In this post we will be explaining how we have created an application for macOS to help administrators quickly parse logs generated by kernel panics on macOS 10.15. Kernel panics can result in a less than ideal experience for users, but administrators can now keep their cool and stay composed when troubleshooting by using Encore&amp;rsquo;s Kernel Composure. The code that makes all of this work is at the bottom of this article.</description>

      <title>Automated addition of VMware VM to Host Affinity Rules</title>

      <description>Background VMware Affinity rules can solve many issues in a virtualized environment with out the need to create different clusters or datacenters to separate Virtual Machines. The specific need that we at Encore had for this was that when a vm is being cloned, if the VM was migrated to a different Host due to a vMotion, the custom spec with Kickstart files or Autounattended Syspreps would fail.
This was a random error that would only happened when vCenter or a host was overloaded.</description>
