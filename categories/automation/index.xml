      <title>Automated addition of VMware VM to Host Affinity Rules</title>

      <description>Background VMware Affinity rules can solve many issues in a virtualized environment with out the need to create different clusters or datacenters to separate Virtual Machines. The specific need that we at Encore had for this was that when a vm is being cloned, if the VM was migrated to a different Host due to a vMotion, the custom spec with Kickstart files or Autounattended Syspreps would fail.
This was a random error that would only happened when vCenter or a host was overloaded.</description>

      <description>When adding disks to VMware VM using Python we need to use the pyVmomi VMware SOAP API to communicate with vCenter. pyVmomi gives us a lot of very helpful features that take out a lot of the guess work in adding new disks to a VMware VM.
You can install pyVmomi from pip into a virtualenv like the following:
virtualenv ~/vmware source ~/vmware/bin/activate pip install pyvmomi  VMware Connection pyVmomi makes it really easy to connect to the VMware vCenter environment to query information and perform all the necessary tasks needed.</description>

      <description>In StackStorm a pack is logical organization that contains related actions, aliases, policies, rules and sensors. To get a good overview of what a pack is please see the excellent StackStorm Pack documentation.
Most users of StackStorm wish to either integrate with a new system that&amp;rsquo;s not available in the Exchange or use StackStorm to execute custom automation scripts. The way to accomplish this is to create a new Pack.</description>
