      <description>In this first installment of a two-part series, we&amp;rsquo;ll be going over Phase One, the build out of the &amp;ldquo;core&amp;rdquo; patching and reboot functionality on Ansible.
History Around a year ago, we began working with a customer who&amp;rsquo;s Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6 and 7 OS patching process was being conducted manually.

Status Report With basic patching and reboots automated, a patching session for application environments without any special pre-patching and post-patching activities was reduced from 20 minutes per server, down to 6 minutes per server.</description>

Before we discuss all of the great things about StackStorm, let&amp;rsquo;s start with a little history.
