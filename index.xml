      <description>When adding disks to VMware VM using Python we need to use the pyVmomi VMware SOAP API to communicate with vCenter. pyVmomi gives us a lot of very helpful features that take out a lot of the guess work in adding new disks to a VMware VM.
You can install pyVmomi from pip into a virtualenv like the following:
virtualenv ~/vmware source ~/vmware/bin/activate pip install pyvmomi  VMware Connection pyVmomi makes it really easy to connect to the VMware vCenter environment to query information and perform all the necessary tasks needed.</description>

      <description>In StackStorm a pack is logical organization that contains related actions, aliases, policies, rules and sensors. To get a good overview of what a pack is please see the excellent StackStorm Pack documentation.
Most users of StackStorm wish to either integrate with a new system that&amp;rsquo;s not available in the Exchange or use StackStorm to execute custom automation scripts. The way to accomplish this is to create a new Pack.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the Encore DevOps blog!
We on the DevOps team have been working for about a year and a half building tons of automation solutions for Encore&amp;rsquo;s Managed Services customers. Up until now we haven&amp;rsquo;t had a place to publicly showcase the more technical work that we&amp;rsquo;ve been doing. This blog serves as a new space for our engineers to share their experiences around new and innovating technologies we&amp;rsquo;re exploring.</description>
