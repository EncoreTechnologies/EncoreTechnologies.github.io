      <description>A common request i&amp;rsquo;ve seen on the StackStorm Slack Channel is the ability to utilize 2-factor auth before executing a workflow. Users sometimes have very powerful workflows that require extra care, or a second set of eyes before executing. Inquiries are an experimental feature in StackStorm 2.5 (changelog) that allow the workflow to pause and wait for input from a user before proceeding. In this post we&amp;rsquo;re going to use inquiries to secure a workflow execution using Duo 2-factor authentication (2FA).</description>

      <description>The following is a quick tutorial on using the ServiceNow API with python to programatically create and update configuration items. A personal development instance of ServiceNow Jakarta was used for testing the code below.

About the ServiceNow API Servicenow uses a REST Table API that allows users to perform create, read, update and delete operations on existing tables. ServiceNow also provides you with a REST API Explorer that uses information from your instance to provide you with a list of endpoints, methods, and variables that you can use to build and send a REST request.</description>

      <description>When adding disks to VMware VM using Python we need to use the pyVmomi VMware SOAP API to communicate with vCenter. pyVmomi gives us a lot of very helpful features that take out a lot of the guess work in adding new disks to a VMware VM.
You can install pyVmomi from pip into a virtualenv like the following:
virtualenv ~/vmware source ~/vmware/bin/activate pip install pyvmomi  VMware Connection pyVmomi makes it really easy to connect to the VMware vCenter environment to query information and perform all the necessary tasks needed.</description>

      <title>Automated creation of StackStorm Packs</title>

      <description>In StackStorm a pack is logical organization that contains related actions, aliases, policies, rules and sensors. To get a good overview of what a pack is please see the excellent StackStorm Pack documentation.
Most users of StackStorm wish to either integrate with a new system that&amp;rsquo;s not available in the Exchange or use StackStorm to execute custom automation scripts. The way to accomplish this is to create a new Pack.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the Encore DevOps blog!
We on the DevOps team have been working for about a year and a half building tons of automation solutions for Encore&amp;rsquo;s Managed Services customers. Up until now we haven&amp;rsquo;t had a place to publicly showcase the more technical work that we&amp;rsquo;ve been doing. This blog serves as a new space for our engineers to share their experiences around new and innovating technologies we&amp;rsquo;re exploring.</description>
