      <description>Migrate Citrix Policies from XenApp 6.5 to &amp;gt;7.6 In this post I will outline the process I used to overcome the limitations of existing Citrix policy migrating tools. Per Citrix, there is no direct path to migrate policies from xenapp version 6.5 to 7.7 or above, you must first install and migrate to 7.6, then do an in-place upgrade to the desired version. (source: docs.citrix.com). Unfortunately, many discover this only after their brand new 7.</description>

      <guid>https://encoretechnologies.github.io/blog/2020/05/kernel-composure/</guid>
      <description>In this post we will be explaining how we have created an application for macOS to help administrators quickly parse logs generated by kernel panics on macOS 10.15. Kernel panics can result in a less than ideal experience for users, but administrators can now keep their cool and stay composed when troubleshooting by using Encore&amp;rsquo;s Kernel Composure. The code that makes all of this work is at the bottom of this article.</description>

      <description>In this post we will be explaining how we have created a chatops workflow that enables us to upload VMWare ESXi log bundles directly to a VMWare support case from our chat client of choice. The code that makes all of this work is at the bottom of this article.
Chatops Introduction For the those who have never heard of chatops before; To me, it means the ability to call automation workflows from your favorite chat client.</description>

      <title>Changing iSCSI LoginTimeout with PowerCLI</title>
      <link>https://encoretechnologies.github.io/blog/2020/03/vmware-iscsi-timeout/</link>

      <guid>https://encoretechnologies.github.io/blog/2020/03/vmware-iscsi-timeout/</guid>
      <description>In this blog post we will be explaining how we are changing the iSCSI LoginTimeout and the reasons why we are doing it in this method.
Background Recently we were going through a code upgrade on our storage arrays and one of the recommendations from Pure support is to increase the iSCSI LoginTimeout prior to upgrading the code. For the uninitiated, VMware defines the LoginTimeout as &amp;ldquo;Time in seconds the initiator will wait for the login response to finish.</description>

      <title>Using Grafana and InfluxDB to Visualize Power Consumption</title>
      <link>https://encoretechnologies.github.io/blog/2019/01/monitoring-power-consumption/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 29 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://encoretechnologies.github.io/blog/2019/01/monitoring-power-consumption/</guid>
      <description>This blog explains how we configured and use Grafana to graph and visualize PDU data stored in InfluxDB.

Background InfluxDB is a time series database that we use to store dozens of metrics from all of our power distribution units (PDUs). This database is updated periodically with a python script that parses snmp data from our PDUs and stores it in the correct table and row. After getting the data into the db, we used Grafana to create graphs of some of the power consumption metrics so that we could easily see how much power was being used by each PDU.</description>

      <title>Automated addition of VMware VM to Host Affinity Rules</title>
      <link>https://encoretechnologies.github.io/blog/2019/01/vmware-affinity-rules/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://encoretechnologies.github.io/blog/2019/01/vmware-affinity-rules/</guid>
      <description>Background VMware Affinity rules can solve many issues in a virtualized environment with out the need to create different clusters or datacenters to separate Virtual Machines. The specific need that we at Encore had for this was that when a vm is being cloned, if the VM was migrated to a different Host due to a vMotion, the custom spec with Kickstart files or Autounattended Syspreps would fail.
This was a random error that would only happened when vCenter or a host was overloaded.</description>

      <description>Virtual Desktops are a topic that runs hot and cold through the enterprise space. Many enterprises begin pilots and projects in the space before building a clearly defined plan, and these are the environments that need additional remediation down the road. Before we start in with architecture, getting a firm answer to “Why do we need them?” is critical to a successfully scope, cost, and validate the design. This month we will focus on the security use case which is one of the ‘easy wins’ for virtual end user compute.</description>

      <description>In this second installment of a two-part series, we&amp;rsquo;ll be going over Phase Two, the build out of standard pre- and post-patching automation, and Phase Three, the build out of application-specific pre- and post-patching automation. Click here for Phase One.
Status Report With basic patching and reboots automated, a patching session for application environments without any special pre-patching and post-patching activities was reduced from 20 minutes per server, down to 6 minutes per server.</description>

      <description>In this first installment of a two-part series, we&amp;rsquo;ll be going over Phase One, the build out of the &amp;ldquo;core&amp;rdquo; patching and reboot functionality on Ansible.
History Around a year ago, we began working with a customer whose Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6 and 7 OS patching process was being conducted manually. This required highly skilled administrators focused solely on patching. Documentation was eschewed in favor of tribal knowledge and manual command entry at the command line presented moderate to high risk during server patching.</description>

      <guid>https://encoretechnologies.github.io/blog/2018/03/stackstorm-changed-our-lives/</guid>
      <description>We started playing around with StackStorm about 9 months ago just to try out some new tools. After a few months of playing around we realized that it was much more than a toy and could provide serious benefits to our DevOps team, our organization and to our customers. Before we discuss all of the great things about StackStorm, let&amp;rsquo;s start with a little history.
History When I started at Encore in June of 2016 the team had just started working on an automation platform.</description>

      <title>Implementing 2-Factor Auth For Workflows In StackStorm Using Inquiries</title>
      <link>https://encoretechnologies.github.io/blog/2017/10/stackstorm-inquiries/</link>

      <guid>https://encoretechnologies.github.io/blog/2017/10/stackstorm-inquiries/</guid>
      <description>A common request I have seen on the StackStorm Slack Channel is the ability to utilize 2-factor auth before executing a workflow. Users sometimes have very powerful workflows that require extra care, or a second set of eyes before executing. Inquiries are an experimental feature in StackStorm 2.5 (changelog) that allow the workflow to pause and wait for input from a user before proceeding. In this post we&amp;rsquo;re going to use inquiries to secure a workflow execution using Duo 2-factor authentication (2FA).</description>

      <description>The following is a quick tutorial on using the ServiceNow API with python to programatically create and update configuration items. A personal development instance of ServiceNow Jakarta was used for testing the code below.

About the ServiceNow API Servicenow uses a REST Table API that allows users to perform create, read, update and delete operations on existing tables. ServiceNow also provides you with a REST API Explorer that uses information from your instance to provide you with a list of endpoints, methods, and variables that you can use to build and send a REST request.</description>

      <guid>https://encoretechnologies.github.io/blog/2017/10/vmware-disks/</guid>
      <description>When adding disks to VMware VM using Python we need to use the pyVmomi VMware SOAP API to communicate with vCenter. pyVmomi gives us a lot of very helpful features that take out a lot of the guess work in adding new disks to a VMware VM.
You can install pyVmomi from pip into a virtualenv like the following:
virtualenv ~/vmware source ~/vmware/bin/activate pip install pyvmomi  VMware Connection pyVmomi makes it really easy to connect to the VMware vCenter environment to query information and perform all the necessary tasks needed.</description>

      <description>In StackStorm a pack is logical organization that contains related actions, aliases, policies, rules and sensors. To get a good overview of what a pack is please see the excellent StackStorm Pack documentation.
Most users of StackStorm wish to either integrate with a new system that&amp;rsquo;s not available in the Exchange or use StackStorm to execute custom automation scripts. The way to accomplish this is to create a new Pack.</description>
